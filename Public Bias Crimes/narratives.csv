65103815576,111252,"On 06.03. I was working routine uniformed patrol as 3 driving a fully marked Seattle Police patrol vehicle. At 2022 hours I was dispatched to: Greenwood Av N ##. Radio provided the following note: 30 MINS, RP HAD AN ARGUEMENT WITH HIS MOTHER. MOTHER SCREAMED AT RP. NO WEAPN IN UNIT.

On arrival I spoke with the reporting party, M said she called the police because she was arguing with her mother, L and M said she was going to call the police, so J preemptively called first. J was visibly upset while we spoke and easily moved between being upset and calm. She said she was upset because her mother always says she's intoxicated when she has an opinion on anything, when she isn't. J said she used to have a drug/alcohol problem but has been sober for some months now. 

L said she had no intention of calling the police, but J wouldn't leave her room when asked. She said she has been practicing setting better boundaries with J and J reacts very emotionally. She also is concerned about upsetting her neighbors because J yells when she's upset, and neighbors have complained in the past. 

L and J both spoke about personal issues from the past that seem to hamper their ability to communicate effectively now. They both agreed giving each other space would be best at this time.  I provided them both with DV pamphlets, as well as an SPD business card with my name/serial and incident # before I left."
