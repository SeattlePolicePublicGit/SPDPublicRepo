Misselwitz 8904, was working uniformed patrol as 3C2 for the Seattle Police Department when I was dispatched to a theft call at 1903 E Denny Way. The call remarks were as follows: INV PLATE THEFT OCCD 5/7 TO 6/2 2250, REAR PLATE STOLEN NOT REPLACED, NEG TOPS/TOWS.

I arrived on scene and spoke with the victim/TONY BURNETT. TONY told me that his car was parked across 19th Ave from 1903 E Denny Way for approximately 3 weeks while TONY was traveling. TONY left on May 7th and received a ticket for not having license plates on the front or back of his vehicle on May 26th. TONY didn’t have a license plate on the front of his car but he said the one on the back was there when he left. 

There was no other damage to TONY’s vehicle and he didn’t notice any license plate thefts on the surrounding vehicles. 

There were no cameras within view of the vehicle. TONY told me he would work on replacing the license plate asap and would put up a temporary tag in the meantime. I gave TONY a card with my name/badge number and the case number on it. I then advised TONY to refer to the case number when speaking to the DMV about obtaining a new plate.",2023-06-03 00:39:17,MARK43

On 06.03.2023 I was working routine uniformed patrol as 3N1 driving a fully marked Seattle Police patrol vehicle. At 2022 hours I was dispatched to: 13410 Greenwood Av N #405. Radio provided the following note: 30 MINS, RP HAD AN ARGUEMENT WITH HIS MOTHER. MOTHER SCREAMED AT RP. NO WEAPN IN UNIT.

On arrival I spoke with the reporting party, MARIONO CENTENO (JULES). JULES said she called the police because she was arguing with her mother, LYNNTOY MARTIN, and MARTIN said she was going to call the police, so JULES preemptively called first. JULES was visibly upset while we spoke and easily moved between being upset and calm. She said she was upset because her mother ‘always’ says she’s intoxicated when she has an opinion on anything, when she isn’t. JULES said she used to have a drug/alcohol problem but has been sober for some months now. 

LYNNTOY said she had no intention of calling the police, but JULES wouldn’t leave her room when asked. She said she has been practicing setting better boundaries with JULES and JULES reacts very emotionally. She also is concerned about upsetting her neighbors because JULES yells when she’s upset, and neighbors have complained in the past. 

LYNNTOY and JULES both spoke about personal issues from the past that seem to hamper their ability to communicate effectively now. They both agreed giving each other space would be best at this time.  I provided them both with DV pamphlets, as well as an SPD business card with my name/serial and incident # before I left.",2023-06-04 00:03:29,MARK43

I spoke to the RP, Sandra Yarbor by phone. She informed me that she believes the staff is stealing her hearing aid batteries.

She believes this because someone told staff that her room was dirty despite her saying that she keeps it very clean. During this time frame, the batteries which she says she keeps in a box disappeared. Sandra then said that she got new batteries the next day only to have them taken again the next day after that. She also said she spoke to staff and security who she claims haven’t done anything to help her. 

The only reason Sandra believes staff stole her batteries is because someone that staff would not identify told them that her apartment was dirty which indicates to her that a staff member was in her apartment to report on the mess. I am unsure as I could not clarify with Sandra if the staff even acknowledged that someone said her apartment was dirty.

On 06/10/23, I was working in a full uniformed capacity with Officer Baldwin #8418 and Sgt. Adams #7447 in an unmarked patrol vehicle. We were directed to be in the area of 9000 Rainier Av S for a possible illegal street racing event.

Upon our arrival, there were well over a hundred vehicles in the parking lot. Numerous vehicles had no license plates or temporary registration visible, which is a common practice for suspects to remove from their vehicles in order to evade capture or future identification when committing crimes (i.e. reckless driving, eluding, vehicular assault).

Several vehicles began revving their engines throughout the parking lot and crowds of people began getting into their vehicles and pulling out of the parking lot. We drove out of the parking lot after several vehicles had departed.

I began driving eastbound on S Henderson St. when I observed another police vehicle (Officer Claxton and Officer Frieler A53) attempt to stop a black and gold Chevrolet Charger further east than our location.

The Charger quickly made a u-turn away from A56 back westbound. The Charger was actively eluding A56 and quickly pulled back into the parking lot that it had left from. I had my lights activated and followed it into the parking lot. 

The Charger was quickly slowed by the excessive traffic in the parking lot. With my overhead lights still activated I stopped behind the Charger and exited my vehicle. The driver's window was partially down and I yelled ""Stop your car right now!"" I used my knife to puncture the driver's rear tire to prevent him from eluding again. The driver, later identified as Mitchell Kapesi, rolled his window all the way down and asked me why. I was at his window and could clearly see him and communicate with him. I told Kapesi, ""You took off. Out of the car now."" He stated, ""I wasn't even doing nothing."" and he began rolling his window up. I yelled, ""Get out of the car!"" Kapesi continued to drive forward so I punctured the front driver's tire with my knife.

Kapesi then drove through a parking spot and on to the sidewalk. He drove westbound on the sidewalk with no regard to the massive amounts of people in and around their cars in the area.

Kapesi drove his vehicle eastbound on S Henderson St. until he turned southbound on Seward Park S. We were blocked bother other vehicles leaving the parking lot so we were unable to keep a visual on the Charger.

A short time later we drove southbound on Seward Park S. when I observed the Charger parked on the northeast side of the intersection with Rainier Av S. The Charger was determined to be unoccupied and was towed for evidence.

Officer Frieler located a WA DOL photo of the registered owner, Mitchell Kapesi, and I verified that he was the driver of the vehicle that eluded A56 and who communicated and failed stop for me.",2023-06-11 00:41:05,MARK43

My current duties include responding to reported crime and emergency 911 calls, enforcing traffic laws, and proactive patrol.  I received my initial law enforcement training at the Southern Arizona Law Enforcement Training Center (SALETC) and was certified as a Peace Officer in the state of Arizona.  From 2012 to 2015, I worked as a patrol officer for the Coolidge Police Department in Coolidge, Arizona.  I then left the State of Arizona in 2015 and was hired on with the Seattle Police Department.  I was certified through the Basic Law Enforcement Academy Equivalency Course for Lateral Police Officers provided by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission.  I left the Seattle Police Department to return to Arizona and work for the Chandler Police Department in January of 2021, and I was re-certified by AZ POST after successful completion of the AZ POST Waiver Test on March 2nd, 2021.  My time as an officer at Chandler PD lasted just over a year before returning to Seattle PD.  

 

In 2013, I completed a 3-day Standard Field Sobriety Test course and am a certified Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus technician.  In 2016, I attended and completed the 16-hour Advanced Roadside Impaired Driver Evaluation (ARIDE) class.  On December 4th-6th, 2017, I completed the Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) Pre-School (24 hours), on December 7th-15th, 2017, I completed the DRE Basic School (56 hours), and on February 5th-9th, 2018, I completed DRE Fields Certs (40 hours) in Phoenix, AZ.  I completed the DRE Final Knowledge Exam on February 26, 2018, and I received my certification from the International Association of Chiefs of Police as a Drug Recognition Expert on 04/01/2018.  On June 15th-19th, 2020, I attended and completed the 40-hour SFST Instructor Course.

 

On 07/09/23 at approximately 2214 hours while working uniformed patrol in the City of Seattle as 3W33 I was dispatched to the area of Lake Washington Bv S and Lakeside Av S as a DRE to assist in a collision.  I was advised that the collision was between a male motorcyclist, identified as Rodrigo Reyes Juarez 10/27/00, and a female motorist.  Officers arrived on scene to find Reyes Juarez unconscious as a result of the collision, making them unable to interview Reyes Juarez about the crash.  

 

I did not arrive on the scene as the person I was tasked with investigating for possible DUI was no longer there and at Harborview Medical Center.  Instead, I was briefed by Ofc To #8467 and Sgt McDougald #6908 via telephone.  The summary of the events they relayed to me were as follows: 

Based on accounts of several witnesses and the other involved driver, it was determined that Reyes Juarez was passing several vehicles while traveling northbound on Lake Washington Bv S approaching the intersection at Lakeside Av S.  Reyes Juarez and his passenger rider (who I did not identify but was identified and interviewed by Ofc Juarez #8628) had been riding a KTM “street bike” with no identifiable registration.  In the act of passing several vehicles northbound in the oncoming lane of travel, Reyes Juarez and his passenger went head on and collided with a vehicle, a silver 2018 Ford Focus bearing Washington license plate BWN3688.  The Ford was traveling southbound operated by Nicole Fleckenstein.  

 

Fleckenstein was the initial reporting party on the collision.  During the investigation she was found to be impaired and was placed under arrest for DUI.  Her account of the collision appears to be reliable based on the preliminary investigation on scene, however, the Seattle Police Department’s Traffic Collision Investigation Squad is completing the investigation.    

 

While Reyes Juarez was receiving aid from the Seattle Fire Department, SFD personnel reported that they could detect the odor of alcohol coming from Reyes Juarez’s person as he was inside of their medic unit.  This information was relayed to me by Ofc To.  

 

Based on the manner in which Reyes Juarez was reported to be operating his motorcycle from eyewitnesses and the mechanism of the collision, along with reports of the odor of alcohol coming from Reyes Juarez’s person, I determined that Reyes Juarez had been operating a motor vehicle and was impaired to an appreciable degree.  Reyes Juarez is currently at Harborview Medical Center receiving treatment for his injuries and is in the custody of Ofc E Juarez #8628.

 

A search warrant was then applied for and granted by Judge Robert E. Chung to seize two vials of blood from Reyes Juarez to determine levels of intoxication.  At approximately 0003 hours blood was taken from Reyes Juarez at HMC by Keith Ferguson, RN.  Prior to the blood draw, I ensured that each of the vials were labeled, had a gray stopper, had not expired, and contained the required “white powder.”  I watched as Ferguson sterilized the area, the right forearm, with Povidone-Iodine and drew the blood.  Ferguson was provided with a copy of the warrant and Reyes Juarez was also provided with a copy of the warrant along with a receipt of the vials of blood taken.  

 

After having the warrant signed, I received further information from Ofc Juarez about the incident.  He had interviewed Reyes Juarez’s passenger rider, who admitted that they had both been drinking beer by the water.  Claiming that they only each had two beers, the passenger asked Reyes Juarez if he was “good to drive” before departing.  When confronted by Ofc Juarez about why he felt the need to ask Reyes Juarez that, the passenger stated he had only known Reyes Juarez for a few months and didn’t know his alcohol tolerance.  

 

The two vials of blood were taken to the SPD Evidence Processing room and submitted for analysis to WSP Toxicology Laboratory to determine levels of intoxication.  A copy of the search warrant, including the receipt and return, were emailed to SMC Search Warrant Return.  The original was turned into SPD Data.  

 

This incident was screened by Sgt McDougald and TCIS Sgt Price.

On 07/09/2023, I was working uniformed patrol for the Seattle Police Department with my student, Officer D. Christensen #8923, who was on his checkout rotation of Field Training. At approximately 2128 hours, we responded to a collision call located at Lake Washington Blvd S / Lakeside Ave S. The call remarks stated the following details: “RP'S VEH VS MOTORCYCLE, SCREENING FIRE”.

Upon arriving on scene, officers observed a vehicle in the roadway that appeared to be in a collision. There was also a motorcycle on its side next to the vehicle. The motorcycle and the vehicle appeared to have been in a collision. Officers then saw that Seattle Fire Department personnel were already on scene. The person riding the motorcycle was later identified as Rider/Rodrigo V Reyes Juarez (DOB: 10/27/2000). R/Rodrigo was receiving aid from SFD personnel. SFD personnel advised that they could smell an odor of alcohol coming from the person of R/Rodrigo.

Officers spoke to several witnesses on scene who stated that R/Rodrigo was riding the motorcycle northbound on Lake Washington Blvd S at the time of the collision. Witnesses advised officers that R/Rodrigo was travelling northbound on Lake Washington Blvd S when he rode his motorcycle into the oncoming lane of travel, crossing a double-yellow divider line, to pass other northbound vehicles. Witnesses advised that while R/Rodrigo was travelling northbound in the southbound lane of travel, a vehicle was travelling in the southbound lane and collided with R/Rodrigo on the motorcycle. The southbound vehicle was being driven by Driver/Nicole R Fleckenstein (DOB: 03/15/1989).

The incident was screened by the Traffic Collision Investigations Squad (TCIS).

At this time, I went to where D/Nicole was standing and spoke to her. D/Nicole was standing next to the vehicle involved in the collision which was a Silver Ford Focus bearing license plate “BWN3688”. A check of the license plate returned reflecting that D/Nicole was the registered owner of the Ford Focus involved in the collision.

PERSONAL CONTACT

I began speaking to D/Nicole. Personnel on scene asked D/Nicole whether she needed any medical attention and she said she didn’t. D/Nicole told me she was travelling southbound at the time the collision occurred. D/Nicole told me she was looking for her belongings inside her vehicle, but at this time, TCIS was responding so I asked her to leave her items in the vehicle. I asked D/Nicole where she was coming from, and she told me she was coming from her parent’s home. I asked D/Nicole whether she had anything to drink today, and D/Nicole quickly said, “no.” I clarified and asked D/Nicole, “Anything at all?” D/Nicole told me “No.” D/Nicole appeared to be calm, and then would become upset briefly, then be calm again at times.

During my conversation with D/Nicole, her speech was rapid, but I was unsure whether it was because she was upset and escalated, or if it was for some other reason. I asked D/Nicole whether I could take a look at her eyes, and she said I could. 

PRE-ARREST SCREENING – FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS

D/Nicole agreed to let me look at her eyes. I asked D/Nicole whether she wears contacts, and she told me she did. D/Nicole confirmed that she currently had contacts in. I began administering the Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test. I asked D/Nicole to follow the tip of the pen I was holding with her eyes and to not move her head. I asked D/Nicole whether she understood, and she didn’t say anything. I asked D/Nicole a second time whether she understood my instructions and she said she did. During the HGN test, I observed lack of smooth pursuit in both eyes, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation in both eyes, and the onset of nystagmus prior to 45 degrees in both eyes. I checked for vertical nystagmus which I didn’t see. I observed a total of 6 out of 6 validated clues during the HGN test. I also checked for lack of convergence, which was present. D/Nicole was unable to converge her eyes as I brought the stimulus toward the bridge of her nose. During the HGN test, I could smell a faint odor of alcohol coming from D/Nicole.

I then asked D/Nicole whether she was on any medication at all. D/Nicole told me she was on “normal medication” and expressed she didn’t want to disclose what medication she was on. I told D/Nicole she didn’t have to. I then asked D/Nicole again how much she had to drink, and D/Nicole told me again that she hadn’t had anything to drink. D/Nicole said, “Nothing at all.” I then asked D/Nicole whether she would be willing to provide me with a breath sample. D/Nicole began slurring her words and told me she had a glass of wine at her parents’ home. I then acknowledged that I heard D/Nicole by repeating that she had one glass of wine. D/Nicole then began stuttering and told me she wished her mom was there.

I then asked D/Nicole whether I could do a couple more tests and D/Nicole told me I could. I acknowledged again with D/Nicole that there were witnesses that indeed said D/Nicole didn’t leave her lane of travel.

I then escorted D/Nicole to where the ground was a little bit more level and provided her with the instructions to the One Leg Stand. D/Nicole expressed that she wanted to try out the test first and I told her she could. D/Nicole wanted to check first because I gave her the option of doing the test with or without her slippers on. D/Nicole then began trying the test and I advised that during the test, she would be required to keep her foot parallel to the floor. D/Nicole then kicked her slippers off. D/Nicole then tried the test and then put her foot down after raises it for a moment. D/Nicole then told me she was supposed to be in an air cast for an Achilles issue. I told D/Nicole we didn’t have to do that test. D/Nicole said if there was a test that didn’t involve putting pressure… and didn’t finish her sentence. Because of this request, I didn’t continue with the One Leg Stand test.

I then administered the Modified Romberg Balance test. I provided D/Nicole with the instructions for the Modified Romberg Balance test and demonstrated the test while I provided the instructions. During the test, D/Nicole had a slight sway while standing. D/Nicole thought about the passage of 37 real-timed seconds when asked to think about the passage of 30 seconds.

I then asked D/Nicole whether she would be willing to provide me with a voluntary breath sample via the PBT. I advised D/Nicole that the results were inadmissible in court and didn’t satisfy the requirement for an evidentiary breath test under the Department of Licensing. I answered questions that D/Nicole had. D/Nicole expressed she would be willing to provide a voluntary breath sample. At approximately 2200 hours, a voluntary breath sample was provided via the PBT which reflected a BrAC of .166.

ARREST AND TRANSPORT

I advised D/Nicole I was placing her under arrest for Driving While Under the Influence. I read D/Nicole her Miranda Rights and asked her whether she understood her rights. D/Nicole said, “Yes.” I advised Sgt B. McDougald #6908 of my arrest decision which he screened on scene. I explained the decision to D/Nicole’s mother who was also on scene at this point. I coordinated with D/Nicole’s mother on the plans moving forward and expressed my intention of getting D/Nicole home after the processing portion of the DUI arrest.

I then escorted D/Nicole to my patrol vehicle where she was placed in properly gauged and double-locked handcuffs. D/Nicole was placed in the back of the patrol vehicle. I sat in the passenger seat while Officer Christensen transported D/Nicole back to the South Precinct for processing.

I arrived at the South Precinct with D/Nicole.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

Once I arrived at the South Precinct, I escorted D/Nicole to the Draeger instrument station and had her take a seat. I then warmed up the machine. I did a mouth check and confirmed that D/Nicole had no foreign objects in her mouth. The mouth check was done at 2244 hours. I asked D/Nicole whether she had anything in her mouth and she told me she didn’t. I asked D/Nicole if I could check in her mouth and she opened her mouth, at which time I didn’t see any foreign objects in her mouth.

As I went through the DUI Packet, I asked the questions from the DUI Interview page of the packet. D/Nicole answered the questions I asked from the packet. For additional details of the answers to the questions, please refer to the DUI Packet and DUI Interview page. I confirmed with D/Nicole that the address provided which was her parents’ residence is a good mailing address for her.

Once the 15-minute observation period was over, I proceeded. I read the Implied Consent Warning for Breath to D/Nicole. Once I finished reading the Implied Consent Warning, I asked D/Nicole whether she would submit to a breath test, and she confirmed she would.

I then entered the necessary information into the Draeger instrument. I confirmed that the breath tube was warm to the touch. and D/Nicole successfully provided two breath samples. I received the following results:

1st Sample (IR): 0.144

1st Sample (EC): 0.147

2nd Sample (IR): 0.137

2nd Sample (EC): 0.139

All the documentation from the incident was printed out. D/Nicole was provided with paperwork from the incident to include an SPD business card with incident number, a criminal citation with a mandatory court date, a DOL request for DUI hearing form, and a copy of the Draeger instrument results.

A routine check of D/Nicole in the MDT system showed no history of impaired driving. Once the necessary paperwork was completed, D/Nicole was released at the South Precinct. D/Nicole was then transported to her parents’ home located at the address provided. We arrived at the home address for D/Nicole’s parents which was provided to officers. I then returned to the incident location with Officer Christensen at which time we stood by. Once the scene was processed, I assisted with following one of the vehicles involved, the motorcycle, as it was towed down to the Vehicle Processing Room.

VEHICLE IN MOTION

On 07/11/2023, I, Officer Rosheger, and my partner, Officer Quiroz were working uniformed patrol with the Seattle Police Department as 3G2. We were conducting uniformed patrol in our fully marked patrol vehicle equipped with emergency lights and siren. 

At approximately 0132 hours, we observed a silver sedan travelling Westbound on Madison St without it's headlights or rear lights activated. We were travelling the same direction behind the sedan. The sedan had WA LIC/CFG0220.

Officer Quiroz activated his emergency lights in order to affect a traffic stop. The traffic was initiated just East of Minor Av and the sedan came to a complete stop on Minor Av just North of Madison St. 

PERSONAL CONTACT

Officer Quiroz went to the driver window and I went to the passenger window. The vehicle was occupied by only the driver. 

Officer Quiroz went back to the vehicle to check the driver's Driver's License. I went to the driver side and spoke with the driver, who identified himself via his Driver's License as Henock Habtu. 

As I spoke with Habtu, I immediately smelled the odor of alcohol coming from Habtu's breath. I also could see that he had watery and bloodshot eyes as well as droopy eyelids. 

Habtu spoke very slowly and quietly and with slurred speech. I also observed that Habtu had dryness of mouth. 

Habtu had repetitive speech often repeating ""I'm sorry,"" ""so sorry"" and ""it's ok.""

I asked Habtu on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being completely sober and 10 being the most intoxicated where he landed. Habtu said 2.

PRE-ARREST SCREENING

I instructed Habtu to step out of the vehicle. Habtu agreed to take the SFST's

Habtu explained that he had completed an associates degree as his highest level of education. 

Habtu also explained that he had no physical impairment other than a minor knee injury. 

Habtu also explained that he had no vision issues and was not wearing contacts. 

I conducted the HGN test. I observed 4 out of 4 clues in Habtu's eyes.

I conducted the Walk and and Turn test and the One Leg Stand and Habtu did well. 

I asked if Habtu wanted to take the PBT test. Habtu agreed and the result came back to 0.127.

At this point, I had probable cause to place Habtu under arrest for DUI under SMC 11.56.020(A).

ARREST AND TRANSPORT

Habtu's vehicle was turned off and secured.

Habtu was placed under arrest and his Miranda read at approximately 0149 hours. 

Habtu was transported to the East Precinct for processing.

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

At the East Precinct, I read to Habtu the implied consent for breath. Habtu agreed to take the BAC test. I conducted a mouth check and observed him for 15 minutes. I conducted the BAC test per training. The results were the following: 1st Sample IR 0.112 EC 0.118 2nd Sample IR 0.108 EC 0.113. 

I gave Habtu his DUI hearing request form and a business card with the incident number.

Habtu was released from the precinct. 

Sgt. James screened the incident and arrest.

Wallace advised it felt like D’Andrea was alternating hitting he with hammer fist punches. Wallace stated D’Andrea hit her all over her body and face but only complained about the pain on her left cheek. Wallace described the assault going on for what she believed to be about a minute.



Wallace stated while she was being assaulted, she told D’Andrea “If you don’t get off, I’ll call the police.” Wallace advised D’Andrea hit her a few more times before stopping. Wallace stated she stayed in the room and sat on the bed that D’Andrea was still on while making the phone call to 911. Wallace advised she’s threatened to call 911 in the past and believes he thought she was bluffing.



Dispatch advised in the call notes they could hear D’Andrea crying and apologizing in the background of the 911 call.



I took photos of Wallace’s injury and uploaded it via AXON Capture to Evidence.com as well as an audio recorded statement. I also provided Wallace with an AXON Citizen link and advised her to submit any other injuries if bruises arise.



SFD E24 responded to evaluate Wallace’s injuries.



History





Wallace advised D’Andrea has physically assaulted on four separate occasions in the past including strangulation during two of the incidents. Wallace was not strangled today and advised the last time she was strangled was in May of 2021. Wallace advised the incident in 2021 was so bad that she had to move away to California to get away from D’Andrea.





Contact with D’Andrea





D’Andrea denied any assault happening claiming Wallace needs medical attention as he believes she has early on-set Alzheimer’s but has not been diagnosed. D’Andrea claimed Wallace woke up and began arguing with him about not cleaning up, throwing items all over the apartment, and claimed the injury she suffered to her face is from falling into a flat screen TV. D’Andrea claimed the TV to be cracked because of her falling, but there were no signs of damage.





Disposition

Based on the totality of circumstances, D’Andrea was placed under arrest for Assault 4 DV with a mandatory arrest as the domestic relationship is parent/child relationship, D’Andrea is above the age of 18, the assault occurred within the last 4 hours, and the assault left a visible injury.



Due to D’Andrea claiming to be bed ridden and not being able to move from his position on the bed due to bladder pain I did not place him in handcuffs, but I advised he would be placed on a gurney and transported by AMR 241 to HMC. D’Andrea was also evaluated by SFD before being placed on the gurney where he was strapped in as he was still placed in custody.



D’Andrea was read his Miranda Rights which he advised he understood and transported to HMC without incident.



Officer Larsen rode in the back of the AMR while I followed behind. Officer Larsen acted as hospital guard. 



SGT. Kennard screened the arrest.

Radio broadcast the following:

“S OF ON W SIDE OF STREET, VEH FACING NB WITH LIGHTS ON, RP UNABLE TO TELL IF VEH OCCUPIED OR RUNNING, NO WEAPNS SEEN.”

Several witnesses called in reporting the vehicle affixed with WA plate CAR4562 was running stopped in the middle of Evanston Ave N. The vehicle was running and angled in the middle of the street. One caller a resident of the neighborhood said they were on a walk when they observed MEDHANIE sitting in the driver seat of the vehicle. They said he appeared to be unconscious. The witnesses said MEDHANIE was in the driver’s seat and the vehicle was running. The windshield wipers were going even though it had not been raining. The neighbors were concerned MEDHANIE needed medical attention, so they called 911. Seattle Fire Department E24 responded and roused MEDHANIE from unconsciousness. SFD also confirmed MEDHANIE was in the driver seat with the car running. SFD said MEDHANIE got out of the car and tried to walk away. SFD said he walked about 10 feet and fell to the ground. SFD tried to conduct a medical evaluation on MEDHANIE, but he would not let them.

I contacted MEDHANIE he was still sitting on the ground. MEDHANIE had fallen asleep sitting up. I woke MEDHANIE and asked him what his name was, he did not answer. When MEDHANIE opened his eyes, they were droopy blood shot and watery. I asked MEDHANIE if he spoke English, he did not respond. I advised MEDHANIE I was contacting him because I was investigation him driving and being under the influence of intoxicating substances or alcohol. I pointed to the car in the middle to the road and asked him what he knew about it, he said it was not his. A record check of the vehicle came back as MEDHANIE being the registered owner of the vehicle.  

I asked him how he got there he said he came from downtown. He said he has been working and event for the past few days. The vehicle and MEDHANIE’s DOL return showed he lives at 12702 FREMONT AVE N, just three blocks northeast of the location.  

When MEDHANIE spoke, his speech was slurred, and he mumbled. I told him I was concerned he might be suffering from a medical condition. I asked him if SFD could check him out. SFD started asking him questions, as they were question him, he fell asleep sitting up.

I asked MEDHANIE if he would be willing to conduct some standardized field sobriety tests, he said he would not. I asked him if he could stand and walk, he could not.

Based on my training and experience I developed probable cause to arrest MEDHANIE for DUI. While MEDHANIE was on the ground I placed him in hand cuffs without incident. My partner Officer French could smell the odor of alcoholic beverage coming off MEDHANIE. After placing the hand cuffs on MEDHANIE we attempted to assist him in standing up. MEDHANIE was not able to stand up by himself. We had to instruct him to get to his knees. MEDHANIE was so unstable we needed to hold on to him to prevent him from falling over. After getting MEDHANIE to his feet he was unable to walk to the back of our patrol car on his own. Officer French and I assisted him in walking to the patrol car and searched him incident to arrest. While searching him he could not stand up by him self and continued to slowly lower to the ground.

Officer French and I transported MEDHANIE to the North Precinct. I applied for and was granted a search warrant for blood. Officer French transported MEDHANIE to Northwest Hospital for a legal blood draw.

MEDHANIE’s vehicle was stopped in the middle of Evanston Ave N blocking traffic. A tow truck was requested to impound MEDHANIE’s vehicle. Office MCCOWAN completed the tow form and waited with MEDHANIE’s vehicle until the tow truck arrived.

Phlebotomist, Landing Kanyi conducted the blood draw. Landing is an experienced phlebotomist and has conducted thousands of blood draws in their career. The blood was taken from MEDHANIE’s left elbow crease and left four arm. The area was sterilized with iodine. Officer French provided vials with grey stoppers and white powder from the blood kit. The lot number on the blood kit was 68109 and did not expire until 11-30-2023. Officer French observed Landing fill the vials with MEDHANIE’s blood at 0145 hours. Officer French labeled and sealed the vials placing them into the blood evidence box. Officer French placed the blood into evidence.

MEDHANIE was released from police custody and stayed at Northwest Hospital. MEDHANIE had other medical conditions and needed to be seen by a doctor.

I completed a search warrant return of service.

Ostrovkin #8151 was working uniformed patrol for the Seattle Police Department as Unit 3-King-3 in the City of Seattle. I was working in a marked patrol vehicle equipped with emergency lights and sirens. At approximately 2005 hours, I was dispatched to a Priority 1 Physical Fight at 1000 Occidental AV S. The call remarks stated: “NEAR HOUSE SAUSAGE STAND ON OCCIDENTAL, 2ND HAND INFO OF PHYSICAL FIGHT, POSS WEAPONS INVOLVED”

During this call, I interacted with the following involved people:

CARPITCHER ASHLEY M. DOB 6/28/1979 – Kitchen Manager of Public Gantry

CARPITCHER ELIJAH P. DOB 9/21/2002 – Kitchen Worker of Public Gantry and ASHLEY’s son

TINNER, LONEYE, T. DOB 10/31/1975 – Owner of BBQ Brisket

I drove to the incident with emergency lights and sirens activated, until I was advised by dispatch that that the parties had separated. When I arrived, I spoke to WSP SGT N. Jennings. He advised that there was a fight at the BBQ Brisket between ASHLEY and LONEYE. LONEYE had punched ASHLEY in the face. Later, ASHLEY’s son ELIJAH came to pick her up from work and was advised of the fight. ELIJAH confronted LONEYE in front of BBQ BRISKET. ELIJAH knocked LONEYE over. LONEYE went to his vehicle to possibly release the rottweiler dog at him. ELIJAH pulled his knife out and told LONEYE that if he didn’t get his dog back he would hurt the dog. LONEYE began returning to his vehicle to possibly get a gun, but 2 of his acquaintances pulled him back and told him that “they weren’t doing that.” As soon as the dog was put away, ELIJAH put his knife away.

I spoke with ASHLEY who advised that she went to apologize to LONEYE regarding a previous incident at the Public Gantry, when LONEYE got upset and punched her in the face and then she hit him back. This incident occurred at approximately 1430 hours in front of LONEYE’s business BBQ Brisket. ASHLEY also claimed that LONEYE did not have a vendor’s license, and that there have been recurring disturbances and disputes between them for approximately 10 months. ASHLEY only wished to have a court order served on LONEYE for her safety.

I gave ASHLEY a Seattle Police Department Domestic Violence Pamphlet and referred her to the section for obtaining a court order.

ELIJAH advised that when he was told about this incident, he went to the BBQ Brisket, knocked over the BBQ Brisket board and demanded to know who hit his mother (ASHLEY). LONEYE got up, ran to his truck to get his dog, a large Rottweiler. ELIJAH told LONEYE that if the dog came toward him, that he would hurt the dog and pulled out a knife to defend himself. ELIJAH described the knife he wielded was approximately 3 inches long. ELIJAH advised he didn’t go within 5 feet of LONEYE, nor run at him, or do anything aggressive towards him. LONEYE told ELIJAH that he would get his gun, and then 2 of LONEYE’s acquaintances held LONEYE back.

I spoke to LONEYE who advised that earlier in the day, ASHLEY went to BBQ Brisket and caused a disturbance, and that ASHLEY punched him in the face, so he pushed her back. Later, ASHLEY’s son, ELIJAH, went to BBQ Brisket, knocked over his sign, and then threatened LONEYE with a knife. LONEYE described the “knife” by pointing at my forearm (approximately 18”). He then retrieved his dog in self-defense. Off-duty WSP Troopers responded and separated the parties. There were other associates with LONEYE who corroborated his statements. When I initially spoke to LONEYE, his large dog was unleashed and roaming freely within his owner’s vicinity. LONEYE also said that ASHLEY did not have a vendor’s license.

I was unable to determine probable cause on either party because of their conflicting accounts of the incident; that their own actions were in defense of themselves. Also, all available witnesses were associated with one of the sides and had conflicting accounts as well. The only independent witness available was the WSP Sergeant I initially contacted, but his account did not provide me with any valuable information to identify a primary aggressor. Furthermore, I did not see any signs of visible injury to all those involved. Any security footage that would have recorded the event were not immediately available. Both parties have said that the opposing side did not have a permit to conduct business in the area, and have said that their dispute has been ongoing for several months.

LONEYE demanded that I arrest ELIJAH for brandishing the knife. I attempted to explain to LONEYE that I would not be arresting anyone, but LONEYE became upset and said I was not taking any law enforcement action because of his race. A supervisor was requested to the scene to screen the bias allegations.

Dispatcher notes are as follows: SFD REQ SPD AND M.E. FOR DOA... 

I arrived on scene and contacted SFD. SFD said the deceased, John B Ewers, had most likely passed approximately three hours prior to their arrival. SFD said the daughter of Ewers, Johnna Ritz, was currently out of town and Ewers was being watched a care taker Luckie. SFD said nothing appeared to be suspicious about this death.

Ewers passed in his bedroom. I observed Ewers laying comfortably in his bed. I did not observe any evidence that a crime had been committed. I took pictures of Ewers and uploaded them to evidence.com.

On a night stand near Ewers' bed I observed bottles of prescription medication. Both bottles had Ewers' name on them. The medications were Finasteride and Mirtazapine.

I spoke to the care taker Luckie who said she last checked on Ewers earlier in the evening. Luckie received a text from Ritz to go and check on Ewers. Luckie said Ewers was unresponsive. Luckie called 911 and began CPR.

Luckie said Ewers had not been eating or drinking well lately. Luckie said Ewers did not eat anything yesterday so she had been trying to get him to at least drink fluids. Luckie said Ewers drank a few glasses of orange juice. Luckie also Ewers had been sleeping a lot lately.

I spoke to Ritz who stated Ewers was not having any current medical issues. Ritz said Ewers had even gotten out of bed into a chair last week. Ritz said Ewers had been sleeping frequently lately. Ritz provided me with Ewers' primary care provider Dr. Madeline Krengel who works out of Pac Med Northgate. Ritz said Ewers had made arrangements through the Coop Funeral Home of the People's Memorial. Ritz said she was currently out of state and that she was having friends respond to the address. Ritz gave her friends to remain at the home until the funeral home arrived.

I spoke to Ritz's friend Kevin Barrett who said he and his wife would stay at the home until the funeral home arrived.

I called the King County Medical Examiner's officer and spoke to Investigator Brown. I provided Investigator Brown with the requested information. Investigator Brown provided me with KCME NJA#23-4094.

I called The Coop Funeral Home of the People's Memorial and provided them with the requested information. I provided them the KCME NJA number. The Coop Funeral Home of the People's Memorial said they would be responding at approximately 0130 hours.

Upon arrival to the scene I was met by Adam Powell (subject/reporting party). I did not see anybody else in the area. Adam stated he was chased by his boyfriend ""John."" Adam has been dating John for approximately 1 year but does not know John's last name or birthday. Adam believes John is approximately 50 years old. Adam described John as a black male wearing a black leather jacket, white beater underneath, black pants, and white shoes.

Officer Loo #8821 conducted an area check while I spoke with Adam and was unable to locate John.

Adam stated John was high on meth and demanded Adam give him back his property which included a phone charger and sunglasses. Adam gave John back the property. The two started walking towards the bus stop and John demanded the same property. The two began to argue. Instead of getting on the same bus with John, Adam started running off to get away from the situation. 

Approximately 20 minutes later John sent Adam text messages that it is ""on site"" next time they see each other and that Adam better give back the property. Adam was walking by 15th Ave Ne/ Pinehurst Way when John appeared out of nowhere screaming and cursing at Adam. At this time according to Adam, John was in full sprint with two big roller bags in each hand. John threatened to hurt Adam. Adam looked back and saw John was holding a pistol in his hand and was pointing it at Adam. John was able to hold the pistol and carry both bags in his hands at the same time. I asked Adam in the past year if he has ever seen John's pistol or heard mention of it and Adam stated no he never knew John had one.

I asked Adam if he could see John right now. Adam replied he was keeping both eyes out. I asked Adam if he was suicidal or had any plans to harm himself or others. Adam replied he did not. Adam appeared to be in crisis but did not meet ITA criteria.

I arrived at the scene with Officer Lombardo #8765, and we contacted the victim, PEREZ CORTEZ, MARIA GUADALUPE (12/22/1980), who said the following: Her husband, HERNANDEZ ESCAMILLA, JOSE L (05/01/1978), assaulted her earlier tonight twice. MARIA stated that JOSE was intoxicated when he assaulted her and she said something to the effect “that JOSE is always drunk”, which is one of the reasons why she does not like him anymore.

MARIA stated that JOSE stopped assaulting her because he ended up leaving the scene, by driving away in his vehicle, WA C46157U, while he was intoxicated.

MARIA had injuries to her face that were consistent with being assaulted. 

MARIA’s son, HERNANDEZ PEREZ, JORGE LUIS (03/18/2004), described JOSE’s vehicle to me as being a brown colored, early 2000’s, Ford F-150 pickup truck.

At approximately 20:52, Officer Lombardo broadcasted that JORGE had informed him that JOSE had just returned home and was trying to get back inside of the house. JORGE said that he witnessed JOSE parking his vehicle, WA C46157U, while JOSE was seated in the front driver seat of the vehicle. JORGE said that there was no one else inside of the car, when JOSE parked the vehicle, and exited the car.

Prior to arriving on scene, Officer Lombardo broadcasted that he had probable cause to arrest JOSE for DV RCW 9A.46.020(B) Felony Harassment.

I arrived on scene at approximately 20:55 hours and witnessed JOSE trying to gain entry into the house. I identified myself as a Seattle Police Officer and asked JOSE to step down from the steps and walk down to the street to speak with me. JOSE complied and I observed JOSE had difficulty maintaining his balance and he fell down, onto the stairs.

JOSE did not injure himself and I grabbed ahold of his arm, to take him into custody for investigation of DV RCW 9A.46.020(B) Felony Harassment.

As I was placing handcuffs on JOSE, I could smell a strong odor of alcohol (ethanol), coming from JOSE’s person. I also observed that JOSE’s eyes were watery and bloodshot red, which is consistent with someone who is under the influence of alcohol (ethanol).

Probable cause was developed to arrest JOSE for SMC 11.56.020 DUI, due to JORGE witnessing JOSE park WA C46157U, while JOSE was seated in the front driver seat of the car, with no other occupant inside of it. Additionally, MARIA stated that JOSE was intoxicated when he left earlier, and I could smell alcohol emanating from his person. I also witnessed JOSE fall down the steps, because he could not keep his balance, along with his eyes being watery/ bloodshot, which is consistent with someone who is intoxicated.

Additionally, empty containers of Alcohol, mainly beer and plastic wine containers, were located inside of the vehicle that JOSE was driving as well.

JOSE was placed under arrest for SMC 11.56.020 DUI, investigation of DV RCW 9A.46.020(B) Felony Harassment, and DV Assault 9A.36.041 Assault 4. 

I searched JOSE incident to arrest, read him his Miranda rights, and transported him to the south precinct for processing.

At approximately 2218 hours, Seattle Municipal judge Robert E Chung found probable cause in my search warrant and gave me permission to sign his name on the search warrant.

Officer’s SERAFIM GABRIEL #8961 and To #8467, transported JOSE to HMC for a legal blood draw.

I knocked and announced that the police were at the front door and the yelling continued and it sounded like there were things being slammed around. It sounded like there was possibly a male voice in the residence. After several times of knocking and announcing that police were at the door, subject/DONIELLE LYNN MANER answered the door.

While MANER was detained, officers observed a large knife on her which was removed from her person. MANER was then frisked, but no other weapons were found on her. 

MANER said that she had been the only one in the residence and the yelling was her talking to someone on her phone and she had been slamming things because she was made.

He stated the vehicle is legally owned by his mother, Jennifer Martin, but he was in possession of the vehicle, WA BEP6387 white Kia Soul. Martin lives at 1806 12 Av and found street parking in front of 1234 E Howell St when he came home from work this morning around 0300-0330 hours.

Martin got up this morning and walked to the grocery store. He did not check on his car while en-route. On the way home he did check on his car around 1220 hours and found it no longer there.

Since Jennifer is the legal owner and lives nearby, I asked Martin if she could have picked it up. Martin said he has spoken to her and she did not as she has her own vehicle.

I have paraphrased conversations and do not include an exact sequencing of events. For any exact quotes or exact sequencing of events, I would refer the reader to my body worn video, as it was recording at the time of this incident. BWC/ICV was active on scene.

Background: I have received 720 hours of training from the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission, including training in the investigation of DUI and the proper procedure involving them. I have received additional training in the investigation and arrest procedures for a DUI through the Seattle Police Department training section. I have been an Officer with the Seattle Police Department for 2 years. I have conducted twenty-two DUI investigations.

I have also completed the ARIDE training course.

Vehicle in Motion:

I was driving westbound on Lenora St and came to a stop at the intersection of 3 Av/ Lenora St. When I witnessed a silver 2009 Toyota Prius (WA-ABD1772) driving eastbound on Lenora St. Lenora St in this part of the city is a westbound only street. The vehicle stopped at the intersection of 3 Av/ Lenora St before turning southbound on 3 Av. I activated my lights and initiated a traffic stop.

Personal Contact:

I contacted the driver who identified herself as Sonya Chi Lien Pien (DOB 08/17/1993) via her valid Washington State Driver’s License. I noticed that both her eyes were bloodshot and watery. I could smell alcohol coming off her. I asked Pien if she had been drinking and she said “yes.” I asked how much she had to drink, and she said, “two beers.” I asked for proof of insurance, she went into her glove box and handed me her registration. She then grabbed her wallet and handed me her medical insurance card; she then was able to hand me her vehicle insurance card. I had Pien turn off the engine and stepped out of the car. I asked Pien on a scale of 1-10 (1 being sober) how intoxicated she felt. She stated, “5 or 6.” Pien also stated that she felt her ability to drive was not impaired at this time. While talking with Pien she was having issues maintaining her balance standing or while walking. At this time, I had reasonable suspicion that Pein was driving under the influence of alcohol.

Pre-Arrest Screening:

I asked Pien if she would take the Standardize Field Sobriety Tests and she said yes. During these test Pien stated that did wear corrective lens and there was nothing medically wrong with her that would prevent from taking these tests.

I first contacted the Horizontal Gase Nystagmus Test. I had Pien stand with her hands to her sides and with her feet together. She was swaying back and forth. I instructed Pien to follow my pen light with her eyes only and not to move her head. She stated she understood. During the test Pien moved her head several times and I took her eyes off the light, I had to verbally correct her.

I checked both her eyes for equal pupil size and equal tracking which she had. Both of her eyes had lack of Smooth Pursuit, Distinct and Sustained Nystagmus at Max Deviation and Onset of Nystagmus prior to 45 degrees.

Next, I performed the Walk and Turn test. I had Pien go to the starting position of having her right foot in front of left foot touching heel to toe. She had trouble getting her feet into the correct position. I informed her to keep her hands to her sides not to being until I told her to start. She stated she understood. I informed Pien to take 9 heel to toe steps down the line on the sidewalk. Then she was to take as series of small steps around her lead foot and take 9 heel to toe back. She was to count each step out loud. She stated she understood. I demonstrated the test with no issues.

On the first set of 9 steps, Pien never counted her steps out loud, on steps 5,6, and 8 she missed heel to toe. She also took 8 steps only and used her arms for balance the whole time.

On the second set of steps, Pien never took a series of smalls steps around her lead foot to turn around. She started walking backwards. On steps 2,3,7 and 9 she missed heel to toe. She used her arms for balance the whole time and did not count her steps out loud.

I then moved to the One -Leg Stand test. I had Pien stand with her hands to her sides and feet together. I told Pien not to do anything until I told her to begin. She stated she understood. She was swaying back and forth in this position.

I instructed Pien when I told her to begin to lift a foot of her choosing, six inches of the ground and parallel to the ground. She was to look at her raised foot and start counting out loud One Thousand One, One Thousand Two, One Thousand Three and so on. She was to keep her hands to her sides. Pien stated she understood. I had no issues demonstrating.

 When I told her to begin, she lifted her right foot off the ground. She placed her right foot down several times and used her arms for balance. She also started to count out loud 1 thousand, 2 thousand and so on, not the way I instructed her to count out loud. She did revert to the way of counting I instructed her. At the end of 30 seconds, she had counted to one thousand fourteen.

Pien did consent to PBT but she could not probably blow into the device.

At this time, I had probable cause that Pien was driving under the influence. I placed her under arrest and read her Miranda Warnings at approximately 0034 hours. I transported her to the West Precinct.

Administrative Process:

Sgt. Matusky #7773 screened the arrest.

I read Pien the Implied Consent Warning for Breath. She agreed to provide two samples of her breath. I performed a mouth check at 0050. I conducted the DUI interview while waiting for the 15-minute wait period to pass. I kept my eyes on Pien the whole time.

During the interview Pein stated that it was 2200 hours on 01/04/2024, when I asked her what time and date, she thought it was. It was 01/06/2024 0055 hours when I asked her this. She also stated she only had two beers and she stopped drinking at 2130 hours. She had 8 hours to sleep that night before.

Once the 15-minute waiting period passed. I input all the necessary information into the Drager instrument. During the first test, Pien was unable to blow properly into the device resulting in a incomplete test at 0113 hours. I coached and demonstrated the proper blowing techniques to Pien and had take a second test on the device.

The results of the first breath sample were IR .152 and EC .162 taken at 0116. The second breath sample results were IR .152 and EC .159.

A background check showed the Pien had no prior DUI incidents. I provided Pien with a copy of the breath test results, towing form, DUI hearing request form and a business card with incident number. Pien was released from custody at the West Precinct.

Pien’s vehicle was impounded due to blocking traffic by a bus stop.

I issued Pien a Criminal Citation (C128495355) for SMC 11.56.020 DUI and a Notice of Infraction (I130320344) for SMC 11.55.020 Right Turn from Wrong Lane and SMC 11.53.020 Fail to Drive on Right Side of Road. Both were sent to the court to be mailed to Pien.

On 01/07/2024 at approximately 0133 hours, I (McDonald #8868) was dispatched to an assault call located at Stewart St and Pike Place. The text of the call is as follows: “MALE HITTING WOMAN ON THE STREET”. I arrived on scene at approximately 0136 hours.

Officer Qualls (#8667), Officer Christensen (#8923) and Officer Misselwitz (#8904) were also on scene as backing officers.

Per dispatch call notes, the suspect is described as a HM, 30, 5'11, MED, BLK LONG SLEEVE, BLU JEANS and the victim as a HF, 20'S, CHEETAH PRINT DRESS.

Upon arrival, the suspect and victim were still on scene. Officers separated both.

I contacted the victim who identified as LOPEZ, FLORA (DOB 09/14/1973). LOPEZ appeared heavily intoxicated and had multiple injuries to the face. LOPEZ was briefly cooperative stating the suspect identified as MORALES, RONNIE (DOB 11/26/1982) had thrown her to the ground and punched her in the face multiple times.

LOPEZ stated MORALES was her boyfriend and had been dating him for approximately 3 years. LOPEZ was embarrassed and continued to cover her facial injuries. LOPEZ had several bruises, a large bump on her forehead and a bloody swollen lip.

LOPEZ gave me permission to take photos of her injuries. These were taken and submitted via Axon capture.

SFD Unit #A2 arrived on scene to render aid. LOPEZ refused medical treatment from SFD.

At this time, LOPEZ became uncooperative and would not provide further details.

Officers with MORALES attempted to speak to him however MORALES was also heavily intoxicated and did not want to speak to officers.

Pike Place Security was standing by and stated there was video footage of the assault. Officer Misselwitz was able to obtain the video footage and submit it via Axon capture. After reviewing the footage, MORALES was seen striking LOPEZ multiple times by throwing punches at her face and kicking her while she was on the ground. LOPEZ was also seen attempting to get up, however MORALES would continue to push her back to the ground.

Based on the investigation, I identified LOPEZ as the victim who was helpless due to her size comparison to MORALES. LOPEZ was defenseless due to her intoxication and was not able to defend herself or contact the police. LOPEZ’s injuries were non-life threatening, however she suffered great bodily harm. MORALES was placed under arrest for DV Assault 2.

There is also history of MORALES being booked into King County Jail for Assault.

MORALES was transported from the scene to the West precinct.

Nangit lives in a shared household with each bedroom being its own separate unit with its own separate lease. Nangit said he left his unit (7) to use the bathroom. Suspect/Efran, E, Marfil (DOB: 03/071962) had just cleaned the toilet before Nangit used the toilet. Nangit said after he had used the toilet there was some urine on the rim of the bowl. Nangit did not wipe the urine off the toilet bowl because he was cold. Nangit went back to his room to watch tv. 

While Nangit was inside his room he heard Marfil yelling “fucking shit” multiple time. Nangit came out of his room and asked Marfil what the problem was. Marfil told Nangit he was angry because Nangit was not wiping the edge of the bowl. Marfil told Nangit he is the one who is cleaning the urine up. Nangit said he must have forgotten to wipe up his urine and he was cold. Unfortunately, Nangit was now mad at Marfil for talking “shit’ about him. Nangit and Marfil continued to argue. Marfil told Nangit not to pull his knife out. Nangit told Marfil he did not have a knife and only had his keys and reading glasses. Nangit went into his room and grabbed his cellphone to call 911. Marfil then grabbed his gun and racked it and pointed it at Nangit. 

I asked Nangit what type of gun Marfil pointed at him and Nangit said it was a stainless-steel gun that was possibly a 9mm or 45.

I acquired Marfil’s phone number and called him asking him to step out of the residence with nothing in his hands. Marfil came out of the residence and complied with all officers’ commands. Marfil was placed in handcuffs for officer safety.

Marfil said he had cleaned the toilet when Nangit used it and left urine on the bowl. Marfil told Nangit he needed to wipe the urine off the bowl of the toilet. Nangit went back to his room and grabbed his jacket. Marfil said when Nangit came back he was looking for a fight. Nangit said to Marfil “what are you going to do” and was lunging at Marfil. Marfil said Nangit had a knife in his pocket. When I asked Marfil how he could see the knife in Nangit’s pocket he said he could see it. Marfil said it was a kitchen knife about ten inches. Marfil said Nangit never pulled the knife out of his pocket. Marfil told Nangit to go ahead and try it. Nangit then said he was going to call the police. 

When I asked Marfil if he produced a firearm during this altercation, he said no. I asked Marfil to describe his firearms. Marfil said he has two rifles and one handgun. Marfil said his handgun was a steel/gray colt 45. Marfil said Nangit has never seen any of his firearms. 

Marfil gave officers permission to enter his apartment and retrieve the gun. I read Marfil his Ferrier warnings and Marfil said he understood. Marfil could not sign the consent to search paper due to being handcuffed. Marfil was escorted into his apartment and told officers where to look to find his silver/stainless colt 45 serial #SN04974E. Based on Marfil stating Nangit has never seen his firearms and Nangit describing the steel colt 4, Marfil was placed under arrest for Assault 1.

Marfil was transported and booked into King County jail. The handgun was placed into evidence at the north precinct. A recorded statement from Nangit was taken and uploaded to Evidence.com. Nangit did not want a business card with the case number.

ICV / BWV

On 2/10/24 at 2255 hours while assigned as Seattle Police Unit 3-David-2, I was dispatched to - 2200 BLK 15th Ave W, Seattle, WA - to assist in a DUI Collision (Officer Involved).

The call read: ""HEAD ON COLLISION OFCR INVOLVED."" Call updates: ""DRIVER IS GETTING OUT; A46 AIRBAGS DEPLOYED,UNK IF INJ.""

Upon arrival, I contacted the driver, Suspect/ Tyrone L. Dixon (B/M/3-3-92) near his vehicle; he was visibly upset yet appeared to be healthy and uninjured. I asked him if he had any injuries, and he told me that he did not. 

While speaking to Tyrone, I smelled a slight odor of intoxicants emanating from his breath (AOB - alcohol on breath). The Seattle Fire Department arrived on scene and evaluated Tyrone for his injuries; I do not know what their medical evaluation determined. 

Later, while on scene, Sgt. Lima requested Officer Englund to evaluate Tyrone for Driving Under the Influence (DUI). Officer Englund conducted Standard Field Sobriety Tests; and upon completion of the SFSTs, he determined there was Probable Cause to arrest Tyrone for DUI-Alcohol; and he was placed under arrest. 

Tyrone's phone began ringing and we allowed him to take the call via video/facetime. While on the call, he stated (to his brother) that he had been drinking earlier but was not intoxicated; he also stated that he fell asleep and got into a collision with the police.

After reviewing Officer Kim's ICV (In Car Video) with him from his computer terminal inside of the SPD West Precinct, it depicted that Tyron was traveling a great distance (100 yards or more) in the wrong way of travel - NB in Kim's SB inside lane. 

Officer Kim slowed and veered to the left (East) into the center lane of travel in attempt to avoid the imminent collision, yet was unable to. The point of impact was the front passenger's side of Tyrone's vehicle and the passenger side rear door panel of Officer Kim's patrol vehicle. (The impact was so severe that door was completely ripped off.)

While at the Precinct, I took digital photographs of Officer Kim's injuries; I later uploaded them into Axon. I also took photographs of Tyron and uploaded them into Axon.

Officer Englund transported Tyrone to Harborview Medical Center and I followed behind.

On 02/11/2024, I was working uniformed patrol for the Seattle Police Department as Unit 3R11 with my partner, Officer S. Gerber #8911. At approximately 0105 hours, we responded to a call for an auto theft. The call remarks stated the following details: “1 MIN AGO, L/S NB ON MCCLELLAN, ATTEMPTED TO STEAL RP'S VEH, RP CHASED THEM OFF, VEH HAS IGNITION DAMG. THRET'D TO SHOOT RP, NO WPNS SEEN”.

Upon arriving in the area, I immediately recognized the victim, since I had responded to a call several months ago where suspects attempted to steal the victim’s vehicle. The victim was identified as Victim/Michael A Young (DOB: 05/08/1985). On the previous incident, the vehicle theft was unsuccessful because V/Young’s vehicle couldn’t be stolen like the majority of the other Kia vehicles that were stolen.

During today’s incident response, the following was reported:

V/Young was in his residence when he heard doors being open. The amount of noise was abnormal to V/Young, so he looked outside, only to discover there were people in his vehicle, which was parked on the west side of the street near the response location. V/Young then confronted the vehicle thieves and asked them what they were doing there. The suspects appeared to be breaking into V/Young’s vehicle. There were two vehicles staged at the intersection for the purpose of animals and suspects fleeing. During the incident, there were two suspect vehicles next to each other facing southbound from S McLellan St / 18th Ave S.

V/Young saw that there were two people attempting to steal his vehicle. Per V/Young, the suspects both fled the scene, getting into each vehicle. Both suspects had entered the passenger side of the vehicle, leading V/Young to believe there were at least four suspects, the two drivers and the two passengers. Due to the lack of lighting and clarity, the suspects that stayed inside the vehicles weren’t seen. 

When confronted, the suspects made threats to V/Young. The suspects told V/Young to “Get the fuck out of here. I’ll shoot you, you bitch ass…” After that threat, V/Young was called the “N-Word.” V/Young then went into his residence where it was safer. V/Young also saw the suspects reach into their waistband, however based on positioning, V/Young couldn’t tell whether they had firearms on them. The suspects then got into the vehicles and the vehicles fled southbound on 18th Ave S. V/Young then checked the inside of his vehicle to discover nothing had happened. V/Young then saw that there was ignition damage to include the ignition cover to be ripped off the vehicle. The driver handle was also broken off the vehicle and left on the driver seat of the vehicle. That was the extent of the damage to the vehicle.

I asked V/Young about the threat and although V/Young wasn’t extremely fearful, he believed there was a chance the suspects had a firearm. Based on the threats to kill, the possible possession of a firearm, and the history of what had occurred, I determined there was probable cause for felony harassment. There was also probable cause for attempted auto-theft based on the damage to the vehicle.

I asked V/Young whether he felt that the suspect indeed had a gun. V/Young never answered. I asked V/Young whether he believed the suspect had a gun and he stated he thought they had a gun then stated that they may have a gun. V/Young described the two vehicles involved as the following: A red smaller model Hyundai and a white Nissan Maxima. The suspect wasn’t located tonight. The suspects were described by V/Young to Officer T. Lombardo #8765. Officer Lombardo broadcasted the suspect descriptions via Radio and Radio updated them as the following: “3R2 SUSP DESC'S- 1. BM,TEENS,6'0-6'3,BLK BAKLAVA,BLK HOODIE,BLK PANTS ...2. LT COMPLECTED BLK MALE,AFRO,GRY HOODIE,BLK PANTS”.

I provided V/Young with an SPD business card with an incident number.

For any exact quotes or exact sequencing of events I would refer the reader to my BWV, as it was recording at the time of this incident.

On 2-11-24 at approximately 2157 hours, I was dispatched to an assault call in my sector. The call read as follows: 1 MIN AGO, RP WAS HIT BY MALE SUSP WITH BACKPACK. NO WEAPONS. SUSP L/S GETTING ONTO BUS SB ON 3

While en route to the call, radio updated the call notes to say that the suspect had allegedly gotten onto the 124 Metro bus and had left the scene southbound. My partner asked that another responding unit respond to the call and attempt to locate the bus. My partner and I arrived on scene at 3 Ave and Virginia St where we located the caller/victim.

On the sidewalk, I contacted the victim – Irvin, Thot DOB 1-21-1995 – who stated that he had been standing at the bus top near 3 Ave and Virginia St when an unknown male approached him and asked for a lighter. When Irvin stated that he didn’t have one, this unknown male used his own backpack to assault Irvin by striking him in the face.

I observed no visible injuries on Irvin’s face and he claimed none. He declined needing to see SFD for medical treatment.

I spoke to a witness on scene – Cruz Elcanta, Hernandez DOB 5-28-1967 – who stated that he saw the incident with Irvin take place. He stated that he saw the suspect strike Irvin, and that the suspect appeared to be intoxicated and “crazy”.

I had originally been told that the suspect had gotten onto the 124 bus, but this turned out to not be true. The suspect actually walked away SB and in an unknown direction once the victim lost sight of him. The suspect was described a s white male in his thirties to fifties with long graying back hair and a black backpack.

3309008,54516979863,REPORT_ID,LKP_REPORTS,MARK43,REPORT_TYPE,REPORTS,"I am Seattle Police Officer Patrick Satterwhite, #8616. My initial law enforcement training took place at the Basic Law Enforcement Academy provided by the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission in the summer of 2018. During my 720 hours of training I learned the proper administration of the Standard Field Sobriety Tests and am Draeger certified. At the Academy I was instructed on collision investigations, traffic enforcement, criminal procedure, criminal law, narcotics field testing and Crisis intervention. I was also instructed on the odors of alcohol, marijuana and heroin.

Following the Academy, I was commissioned with the Seattle Police Department. I completed my FTO training and am currently assigned to 3rd Watch MARY Sector which include the Pike Place Market area. I voluntarily enrolled in additional training for DUI Investigations to include:

- DUI Detection & SFST training – 24 hours
- Advanced Roadside Impairment Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) course – 16 hours
- Certified Draeger Alcotest 9510 Instructor – 16 hours
- Cannabis impairment & “Green” Lab – 8 hours
- Preliminary Breath Test Operator

At the time of this incident, I was working in a marked patrol vehicle in my issued uniform. The entire incident took place within the city of Seattle.

On 2/28/2024 I was working in uniform for the Seattle Police Department as 3M22. At 2353 hours I was driving a marked patrol vehicle westbound on BELL ST passing 2 AV. Halfway between 1 AV and 2 AV was the alleyway entrance or exit. As I approached the alleyway, I observed a Grey Volvo SUV (WA CLU9167) exiting onto BELL ST from the north. It was traveling fast enough that when the driver saw my patrol vehicle he slammed on the breaks and the rear of the car lifted as the weight of the car shifted forward before coming to a stop just short of BELL ST. I noticed the Volvo early enough that I was able to stop my patrol vehicle before entering its path.

It's important to note when the Volvo exited the alleyway it did not slow when driving onto the sidewalk. Had a pedestrian been walking on the sidewalk as the Volvo exited the alleyway, the driver would not have sufficient time to stop before colliding with the pedestrian. I estimated he was driving approximately 20-25 MPH.

I activated my overhead lights and approached the driver’s side window for speeding in an alleyway.

PERSONAL CONTACT:

As I approached the driver (later identified as SUSP/LUXENBURG, Colton) I could immediately smell the odor of alcohol coming from inside the vehicle. LUXENBURG’s eyes were watery. He told me he made a mistake and though the alleyway extended through BELL ST, explaining his speed.

I asked him for his driver’s license and proof of insurance. He began looking through his glove box and quickly handed me his vehicle registration. I told LUXENBURG I didn’t need his registration. He responded, “You said proof of registration.” He then handed me his driver’s license and soon after provided his proof of insurance via cell phone.

LUXENBURG told me he just left Jupiter Bar (2126 2 AV) after playing some games. The establishment is known for pinball and various arcade games. He admitted to drinking two double tequila sodas. I told LUXENBURG I could smell alcohol in his car and asked if he was safe to drive his vehicle. He believed he was.

I asked him on a scale from 1-10 how intoxicated he felt. 10 represented a high level of intoxication. LUXENBURG currently felt like he was a 3.

Because LUXENBURG was unable to determine he was leaving an alley and entering the roadway on BELL ST, admitted to drinking two double tequila sodas and was driving a vehicle that was emanating a strong odor of alcohol I requested he step out of the vehicle to begin a DUI investigation. 

SFSTs:

Weather conditions: low 40s, 10-15 MPH wind, moderate rain, wet pavement. Slight slope decreasing from east to west. Much of the testing took place under an awning at 106 BELL ST. 



I told LUXENBURG I had more questions for him and I would like him to perform voluntary testing to help me determine if he was safe to drive his car.

LUXENBURG stated he had no physical limitations and his highest level of education was college. He is prescribed 15 milligrams of Adderall to take as needed. He initially stated the last time he consumed a dose of Adderall was last Thursday.

HGN: 6 Clues

No resting nystagmus and pupils were equal in size. He was able to track my stimulus. I observed nystagmus during lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation and onset nystagmus prior to 45 degrees. I also observed vertical nystagmus. I could still smell the odor of alcohol coming from LUXENBURG when he was away from his vehicle.

Walk and Turn: 3 Clues (can’t keep balance, improper turn, stops while walking)

As we moved on with testing LUXENBURG began to intermittently cry. He was feeling overwhelmed with the investigation. I tried to calm LUXENBURG, telling him to take a breath and allowing him time to calm himself.

I instructed LUXENBURG into the starting position and told him to place his hands at his sides. Instead, he raised them up. After I demonstrated the test and was providing instruction LUXENBURG began leaning forward to start the test. I told him to stop and he didn’t take his first step. I continued with my instructions, but LUXENBURG began to show signs of panic. He told me to carry on with instructions, which I did.

I explained the test multiple times because LUXENBURG had trouble comprehending the test. I decided it would be best demonstrate the test again from start to finish with the instructions. As I was doing that, LUXENBURG lost his balance. As LUXENBURG was about to start walking he stated he was very nervous and that his heart was racing. I told him his safety was paramount and that he didn’t need to participate in the test. He said he would be fine and would participate in further testing.

He started the test and made the correct number of steps. After his first 9 steps he stopped and said, “Turn around?” I told him to complete the test with the instructions I provided. He then swung his back foot around his front foot and pivoted. He then completed the remainder of the test with no more clues observed.

One Leg Stand – 2 Clues (Sways, Puts foot down) 

I provided the instructions to the test and told LUXENBURG to begin. He began counting but forgot to say the “thousand” portion of (One-THOUSAND-One, One-THOUSAND-two….etc…..) He swayed to his right and put his foot down for balance twice. Around 20 seconds into the test LUXENBERG stopped on his own and said he was sorry.

PBT – .227

I requested LUXENBURG provide a breath sample to test for alcohol concentration. I told him the results could not be used against him in court. He agreed. At 0007hrs he provide a breath sample resulting in a .227 reading.

ARREST DECISION:

LUXENBURG’s fast driving while exiting an alleyway, odor of alcohol, admitted alcohol consumption from a nearby bar, self-evaluation of a 3 our of 10 relating to impairment, performance on SFSTs and PBT result led me to believe he was driving a vehicle while impaired. I took him into custody for DUI and read him his Miranda Warnings. He acknowledged verbally. I searched him incident to arrest and placed him in the back of my patrol vehicle. He did not have anyone who could pick up his vehicle and he did not have confidence his two passengers were sober enough to drive. His vehicle was impounded and I provided him the proper paperwork.

I transported LUXENBURG to the West Precinct and turned on the Draeger Instrument. I escorted LUXENBURG into the BAC room and conducted a mouth check at 0026hrs. No foreign substances were located. He remained in my direct or peripheral view for the remainder of our time in the BAC room. I completed the DUI packet to the best of my ability.

ICW

I read the Implied Consent Warnings to LUXENBURG. He did not express any confusion and agreed to provide breath samples. I felt the hose and it was warm to the touch. LUXENBURG provided the following results:

IR .177 / EC .181 @ 0046hrs

IR .186 / EC .1.90 @ 0051hrs

I provided LUXENBURG a DOL hearing form and all other required paperwork. I was unable to check his criminal history and he was released from the West Precinct.

On 4/2/2024 at approximately 2146 hours, I Officer West #8091 was on routine patrol within the City of Seattle in a marked police vehicle wearing class B uniform when I was dispatched to a DV harassment call at 1305 Ne 43rd St.



The remarks of the call are as follows: “PER ANI/ALI... RP REPORTING ROOMMATE THREW BOTTLE AT SOMEONE AND VIC BLEEDING”.



I arrived at the scene at 1305 Ne 45th St at approximately 2157 hours. We located the involved subjects on the 4th floor of the building. There are two subjects (Jason Adams & Robert Soxx) that live in unit 407. There were additionally three other subjects that are friends with the roommates. They are all friends and were hanging out this evening drinking. 

During my investigation it was difficult to interview Soxx and get details regarding the incident. The friends (Laim McDonald & Melanie Amaro Chiang) that witnessed the incident, were more willing to provide information. The 3rd friend refused to provide the police with his information. Soxx and Adams are currently living together but are both in the process of moving out of the building. They all stated that when Adams drinks, he becomes angry and sometimes violent. Tonight, he became upset and broke a wine bottle inside the unit. In the action of breaking the wine bottle, he injured himself, cutting his hand and shin. The friends stated that he was bleeding heavily earlier but it seemed to be reduced. 

Soxx and the others were in the process of leaving the unit for the night when the police arrived. They stated they only would like medical attention for Adams. They stated that no crimes had occurred. Once they went in the unit to ask if he would come out to receive medical attention, he declined all assistance and began to yell at his roommate again. Adams said he was going to sleep and Soxx and the others were going leave the building. We then cleared the scene.

Approximately 10 minutes later, (2213 hours) 911 received another call reporting a disturbance occurring between Adams and his friends. The remarks of that call are as follows: “ANOTHER CALLER CALING BACK AND STATING MALE BROKE A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND ATTEMPTED TO STAB HIM WITH IT”. “FROM THIS UNIT, MALE YELLING AT GUESTS, AT LEAST 3 OTHERS INSIDE, MALE POSS HAS SOMETHING IN HAND HE IS SLAMMING ON GROUND - UNK WHAT”. Officers returned to the scene to investigate the new events.

While Soxx was grabbing some belongings to leave, Adams came out of his unit. Adams was yelling and being aggressive towards his friends and Soxx. They were all in the hallway. Adams was intentionally dripping blood around the building and towards the others. Neighbors called 911 to report the disturbance. Adams broke a piece of furniture off from inside the unit, that appeared to be a wooden leg from a coffee table. He slammed the wooden stick on the hallway floor. This caused the wooden leg/stick to be broken, making it sharp and more of a stabbing instrument (like a broken pool stick). Adams held the stick up in the air in a threating manner towards Soxx. He was standing approximately 5ft away from his friends and Soxx. Soxx was sitting on the ground of the hallway with his hands over his head and knees to his chest, trying to protect himself from Adams. Adams yelled “I’m going to kill you”, making the threatening statement towards Soxx. The other friends got in between the two. They called 911 and went down to the lobby to wait for officers. Adams went back into the unit. They said he never swung the stick at Soxx or any others involved. No one was injured. 

Once officers arrived, we interviewed each subject involved regarding the developments of the incident. Soxx continued to not be willing to provide information. He appeared tired and nonchalant about the situation. 

We went to the unit to contact Adams. We created a plan for contacting him, providing roles and assignments. We used the stairwell door as a barrier and called Admas out to us. He stepped out of the unit into the hallway where we placed him in custody for DV felony harassment. He was placed in custody without incident. 

Officer Kaukula took photos of the scene and of the tool used in the crime. There was blood in the hallway along the walls and floor. The door to unit 407 was significantly damaged. I submitted the weapon used in the crime into evidence at the North Precinct. 

Adams was medically evaluated by Seattle Fire Engine 17 at the scene. 

Sergeant Sullivan #8475 screened the arrest at the scene.

Officer Bailey and Kaukula transported Adams to King County Jail where he was medically declined. He was then transported to Harborview Medical Center.

On 04/06/2024, I was in full uniform driving a marked patrol vehicle as 3E12. At approximately 2003, I self-dispatched to a Burglary Call at 801 29th Ave E, Seattle. Call comments included:

I/P. INSIDE CARPORT, CHK FOR ON RP'S NBR'S PROPERTY. UNK IF OWNERS OF LOC ARE HOME, RP IS UNABLE TO REACH THEM VIA PHONE. APPEARS HIGH/INTOX, SUSP SEEN LAYING DOWN, SINGING. NO WPNS SEEN.

HOMEOWNER/JEREMY STILL SEES SUSP INSIDE THE CARPORT. APPEARS HIGH/INTOX--SPINNING AND YELLING. IS ALSO PUTTING ITEMS IN A BAG. VIDEO NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO SEE IF THEY BELONG TO THE SUSP OR RP

Upon arrival, I checked the carport of the home, which was empty. I also knocked on the door, but received no response. I was then approached by the complainant, later verbally identified as Christopher N. Lloyd (W/M 10/09/1986), who is a neighbor living next door in #807.

Lloyd advised that he had seen the suspect taking items and then leaving, last seen in an alleyway behind the homes. Lloyd stated that he had caught the suspect on his home camera. I later sent him an AXON citizen link to upload any evidence he might have.

I located the suspect, who matched the description, in the alleyway behind the homes. I contacted him, and he verbally identified himself as LOBO, ANDREW L. (W/M 06/29/1987). 

LOBO spoke rapidly and initially gave multiple different names as his. He admitted that he had been on the property in questions and readily proffered his bags for us to search before we could even ask. He appeared to be unsure which items he had taken from the property at 801 29th Ave E, but singled out an outdoor thermometer made of wood with pink sand inside as coming from the property.

Shortly thereafter, I contacted the homeowner of 801 29th Ave E, Jeremy D. Fehr (W/M 01/26/1991), who was identified by WA DL. Fehr stated he had also seen the suspect rummaging through his property via a video camera. He checked his property, and determined the only item that was of value (that was not intended to be disposed of) was the wooden thermometer, which Fehr was able to describe perfectly.

I returned the thermometer to Fehr. He stated he would cooperate with prosecution and wanted to press charges for the theft. I advised him I would recommend charges to the SCAO. I provided him with a business card with the case number, and also sent him an AXON link to upload evidence from his camera. 

SUSPECT LOBO entered onto Fehr's private driveway that was clearly not open to the public, as it was away from the private sidewalk and was adjacent to his home, and had private property/belongings on it next to the home.

Additionally, LOBO stole the wooden thermometer from FEHR.

I advised LOBO he was trespassed from Fehr's property and not to return, and that charges would be recommended to the SCAO. He was later provided a business card with the case number.

While checking LOBO's name, I discovered a KCSO ITA-Order for apprehension (Misdemeanor Warrant) in WACIC.

SPD Dispatch verified the order, and I requested an AMR for detention and transport to a medical facility for Involuntary Mental Health treatment.

Sgt. Semler #7743 screened the execution of this ITA Order/Warrant as well as the CBO (Charge-by-Officer) by phone.

AMR 233 arrived, and LOBO was secured to the gurney. He was then transported to Swedish Hospital Cherry Hill for treatment.

On 4/12/2024 I was working in full uniform as part of the Community Response Group with call sign Adam-53. I was driving a fully marked Seattle Police patrol pickup truck equipped with lights and sirens. I was working with Officers Lasko #8800 and Clark #8310.

At approximately 2005 hours, we responded to an armed carjacking in the 9200 block of 35th Ave SW. While en route to the call, there were multiple updates broadcast over radio. The updates were that two suspects, both armed with handguns, arrived in a black Hyundai SUV and stole a white Audi SUV at gunpoint. Primary officers broadcast that they were tracking the stolen Audi to the area of SW 112th St/15th Ave SW and we responded to that area. King County Sheriff's Office Guardian One also updated that they were en route.

At approximately 2011 hours, officers updated that they had eyes on an Audi south of the intersection of SW 112th St/15th Ave SW. This is the area where the stolen vehicle was tracking.

At approximately 2015 hours, I was driving westbound on SW 116th St and searching for the second involved black Hyundai SUV that was used in the armed carjacking. I observed a black Hyundai SUV traveling eastbound on SW 116th St and it did not appear to have a front license plate. After the vehicle passed us, I saw the driver pass recklessly pass a vehicle on the shoulder of the roadway.

This Hyundai was located in close time and proximity to the carjacked Audi and was traveling away from the Audi where officers were contacting it. I turned around and caught up to the Hyundai near the intersection of SW 116th St/1st Ave SW. The driver of the Hyundai turned southbound on 1 Ave S and I could see that it had a temporary vehicle license plate where the rear license plate would be. Officer Lasko broadcast the suspect vehicle and our direction of travel to coordinate getting additional officers into the area.

I followed the Hyundai southbound on 1st Ave S and the driver increased speed. The suspect driver failed to signal several times while changing lanes and swerved twice over the solid yellow center double line in the roadway. The suspect was speeding until he slowed for a red light near the intersection of 1st Ave S/SW 128th St. I got caught up to the vehicle and we broadcast the temporary license plate as: A7152668. The vehicle appeared to be a dark grey Hyundai Tucson. 

The suspect temporarily stopped in the right turn lane at the red light, and then began moving forward into cross-traffic nearly causing a collision. Based on my training and experience, Hyundai vehicles are often stolen. There was probable cause that the occupant(s) of the Hyundai were the suspect(s) who carjacked the victim of the Audi and were attempting to flee the area. The suspect(s) in the Hyundai posed an imminent risk to the public and the safety risk of failing to apprehend the suspect(s) was greater than the safety risk of a pursuit under the circumstances because these two suspected demonstrated the means and intent to commit violent felonies against additional victims. A pursuit was pre-authorized by Sergeant Couet #7758 who was monitoring.

I activated my emergency lights and sirens to initiate a stop and investigate the occupants of the Hyundai. The suspect drove through the red light nearly striking another vehicle and turned eastbound on SW 128th St. The driver failed to stop, increased speed, and continued driving recklessly in an attempt to elude police. Officer Lasko continuously broadcast speeds, roadway conditions, and traffic updates during the vehicle pursuit. I am PIT-certified and this was broadcast as our plan to end the pursuit as soon as possible.

Another police vehicle with activated emergency lights took the pursuit lead vehicle position near the intersection of 1st Ave S/Olson Pl SW. I last saw the suspect vehicle turn westbound on SW Roxbury St.",2024-04-13 01:35:06,MARK43

On May 25, 2024, I was working a uniformed patrol in a marked Seattle Police vehicle and assigned to call sign 2-QUEEN-2. At approximately 1513 hours, I responded to a 325 7 AV N (Civic Hotel “temporary housing”) in Seattle, WA to investigate a death of a newborn. 


The remarks of the call are as follows: “JOIN SFD FOR MOTHER WITH STILLBORN CHILD”


Involved Parties:

Reporting Party: Director of Outreach- CO-LEAD/ALEXANDER, Nichole K. (DOB 09/04/1980) 

Subject: Supervisor of CO-LEAD/ QUINN, Charles F. DOB 05/07/1977)

Arrestee and MOTHER of decedent: CREIGHTON, Ashlee Montana (DOB 09/02/1991)

Decedent: Baby Astraea CREIGHTON (DOB 05/18/2024)

Subject/Neighbor in #324/POPPE, Brenna (DOB 11/14/1987)

Upon arrival, I contacted Officer M. GORE #7932 and Sergeant D. DO #7770 and Nichole outside of unit #325. Officer M. GORE advised that the newborn was deceased.


I observed Seattle Fire Department Aid #4 (SFD# F240069828) Lieutenant BOURGETTE and Captain ANDERSON exiting Unit #325. 


I entered Unit #325, a small hotel room approximately 200 square feet in size. The room is equipped with a mini fridge but did not have a stove or an oven. The bathroom is equipped with a shower, no bathtub.


Upon entry, I observed the window open, and the room was cold. The temperature in Seattle was a high of 59 degrees. There was a slight odor of decomposition in the room. Immediately to the left of the unit door was the bathroom. I observed a toilet that appeared to be turned to the right side and knocked off the wax ring that typically secures a toilet to the floor. The shower contained a large gray storage container filled with water. There were other items inside the shower (clothes on the shower floor and other items typically not kept inside of a small shower) that would make it difficult to use it for the intended purpose. The bathroom had broken glass on the floor, the sink was filled with items to include dried red roses and toiletries deeming it unusable for the intended purpose. Inside the bathroom I observed used foil with scorched marks consistent with drug use. I observed several canisters of NARCAN in the unit. There were torch lighters and used melted pens/pipes which are both consistent with drug use.


I did not observe baby formula or bottles in the room. I observed old food and ice-cream containers in the trash. 


I walked further into the room and observed a unkept room. There was drug paraphernalia on the floor to include uncapped needles and foil squares.

There were small pieces of foil on the floor with scorch marks. There was clothing laying on the floor and clutter on the counter tops. 


I observed an unmade bed with sheets and a comforter on a mattress. There was an open container containing drug paraphernalia. There was a red “First Aid Kit” that was closed. On the lower left side of the bed, I observed white blanket that covered a deceased newborn approximately a week old. Baby ASTRAEA was wearing a white onesie, mint green pants and had a mint green knit sweater draped around her body. Her head and neck area appeared to be jaundiced. The end of her fingertips (fingernails) were red. I observed the early signs of decomposition on her feet. I uncovered Baby ASTRAEA and unsnapped her onesie which revealed a diaper. I observed moderate decomposition on her stomach that was green in color. I observed a brownish dried umbilical cord that was approximately two inches long and not clamped. I did not observe blood or vernix on the baby. 


No life saving measures were performed by police or Seattle Fire Department due to the obvious signs of decomposition. 


I covered Baby ASTRAEA and exited the room.


After exiting the room, without provocation Nichole advised that ASHLEE did not want to speak to officers and an attorney was in route. Nichole was advised that ASHLEE was in Unit #303 with CO-LEAD Supervisor, Charles. 


I contacted ASHLEE in Unit #303. ASHLEE was fully dressed in clean clothes, wearing makeup, writing in a journal, and had bags packed like she was leaving for a vacation. ASHLEE was emotionless. She did not cry or seem distraught. ASHLEE didn’t appear shocked that officers were there. It should be noted that upon entry into Unit #303 and without provocation, Charles advised that ASHLEE was invoking her rights to an attorney. 


ASHLEE was read her MIRANDA rights, acknowledged that she understood and invoked her right to remain silent. Due to the circumstances, I asked ASHLEE if she wanted to seek medical attention. ASHLEE advised that she wanted to go to the hospital. 


During the interaction with ASHLEE, Charles was texting and asking questions on where ASHLEE would be going so their (CO-LEAD) attorney could meet her there. 


ASHLEE was advised that she was not free to take her property at this time. 
Sergeant D. DO #7770 was on scene to screen this arrest. 


ASHLEE was placed on the AMR gurney and transported to Swedish First Hill by AMR #223 (EMT Charlie SONMORE). 


I remained on scene and held on Unit #303 with Detective G. TOMLINSON #5913 until SAU (Sexual Assault Unit) Detective Sergeant P. ST. JOHN #5912 and Homicide Sergeant J. SAMSON #6421 arrived on scene and took over the investigation. 


Nichole provided a key card for Unit #325, and I secured the door. I remained at the door of Unit #325 until cleared by Officers A. ESTRADA #8608 and M. ROY #8983. 


I briefly returned to the West Precinct until Detective HINSON completed the warrants and then returned to Unit #325 to serve the warrant with detectives. 


I contacted KCME’s (King County Medical Examiner's Office) and spoke to Investigator Kymm BRYCE who advised that she would be responding. KCME #24-01580. 


I returned to Unit #325 and served the warrant with detectives. I observed scorched foil throughout the room which is consistent with drug use. I observed uncapped used needles on the floor. Investigator BRYCE located a heavily soiled diaper in the trash containing feces. Detectives located a white tee shirt soiled with feces.

A calendar was located that documented the birthday as follows, May 18: “Baby Girl born at 2:27.” 
On the box for May 24, it documents the following: “Baby Girl ASTRAEA Maria RIP. TOD 1-ish? Thurs 5.23 rose to the heavens on the beautiful and bright full moon. The writings continue for May 23 in the calendar box for May 31 where it documents, “I’m sorry that I failed you. I will never forgive myself.” 

See officer statements for additional information and items of evidentiary value submitted into evidence. 


While standing outside of Unit #325, a neighbor residing in Unit #324, POPPE, Brenna (DOB 11/14/1987) advised KCME Investigator BRYCE and Detective Sergeant P. ST. JOHN the following:


Brenna advised that MATT (the father of the decedent) is concerned for the baby’s welfare. Brenna saw the baby two days ago and was perfectly healthy. Brenna advised that the staff all knew she was pregnant. 


After completing our investigation, it was determined that probable cause exists to arrest ASHLEE for RCW 9A.42.030 Criminal Mistreatment in the Second Degree. 


RCW 9A.42.030 Criminal Mistreatment in the Second Degree requires: A parent of a child, ASHLEE is the mother of the decedent, Baby ASTRAEA.

The person entrusted with the physical custody of a child or dependent person, a person who has assumed the responsibility to provide to a dependent person the basic necessities of life, or a person employed to provide to the child or dependent person the basic necessities of life is guilty of criminal mistreatment in the second degree if he or she with criminal negligence, as defined in RCW 9A.08.010, either (a) creates an imminent and substantial risk of death or great bodily harm by withholding any of the basic necessities of life, or (b) causes substantial bodily harm by withholding any of the basic necessities of life.

I remained on scene until cleared by Detective Sergeant P. ST. JOHN #5912.

I returned to the West Precinct and completed the necessary reports and an updated superform to reflect the updated charges for RCW 9A.42.030 Criminal Mistreatment in the Second Degree.

Subject: NILA J GORDON (DOB 11/29/1973)

Upon arrival, I met S/GORDON sitting on a planter box at the Belltown Inn located at the corner of 3 Ave/Bell St. S/GORDON was speaking with slurred speech, and it was difficult to initially understand the circumstances of the call. S/GORDON stated that she was scared, wanted an ambulance to go to the hospital. After several attempts of asking about the circumstances, S/GORDON stated that she felt uncomfortable talking to officers and she that she was sexually assaulted in either a nearby older green Honda Accord or the alley between 2nd and 3rd Ave/ Bell and Blanchard St. No further information was given at this time. Officers requested an AMR for S/NILE to transport to HMC for a Sane Nurse. 

While waiting for the AMR to arrive, I spoke with RP/CHRICTON. RP/CHRICTON stated that he is security for the Belltown Inn located at 3 Ave at Bell St. RP/CHRICTON said that he was patrolling the property when S/GORDON asked him to call an ambulance for an unspecified reason. RP/CHRICTON further asked why S/GORDON wanted an ambulance. S/GORDON stated that she was assaulted. IP/CHRICTON called 911. 

I then followed AMR # 220 to HMC.

Upon arrival to the HMC. I attempted to interview S/GORDON as she stated that she would talk to officers there. S/GORDON was sleeping deeply, and I had to wake her several times to attempt to interview her.

S/GORDON stated that earlier in the day she was with some unidentified friends in a green Honda Accord. They had driven to various stores to get alcohol and parked in a parking space along Blanchard near 3 ave. S/GORDON fell asleep at an unknown time and said she was woken up by three unidentified men dragging her out of the car. I then asked S/GORDON if she knows the identity of the individuals, she stated “No.” When asked if there was force, she said “No.” I then asked if there was penetration. S/GORDON again stated, “No.” 

S/GORDON stated all she knows is that she was “swollen” in her vaginal area and there was an abrasion there as well.

S/GORDON then stated that she didn’t know if anything happened in a vehicle or the alleyway. S/GORDON just wanted to sleep and was concerned that she had left her jacket somewhere. 

S/GORDON was provided with a business card with officer’s names, serials, and incident number. S/GORDON was also advised to call back if she remembers any details about the incident and refer to the case number provided. 

Officers conducted an area check for the vehicle but were unable to locate the older model green Honda Accord in the nearby area. 

S/GORDON signed a medical release and was sent to DV per SPD Policy. 

A copy of the medical release form was also attached to this incident.

Orantes am a commissioned police officer in the State of Washington, employed by the Seattle Police Department as a police officer and assigned to SPD South Precinct 3rd watch patrol with my FTO M. Rodrigue. On June 04, 2024, I was wearing my department issued uniform and working in a fully marked police vehicle within the City of Seattle. I was assigned as patrol unit 3S12.

I was dispatched to an Assault located at 5518 20 Ave S at approximately 0038 hours.

Call read as is: “LANG BARRIER, RP'S 27 YR OLD SON WANTS TO KILL HIS MOM. HE HAS MENTL ILLNESS, MORE TO FOLLOW, HE ASLTED THE MOM JUST NOW. Suspect TAN COMPLECTED MALE, 27, GRY SHIRT, GRY PANTS.

Upon arrival, Officers located a vehicle matching the description bearing Washington license plates (CAK1272) driving eastbound on S Orcas St, the vehicle then made a right-hand turn going southbound on 22 Ave S. Officers pulled the vehicle over on the intersection of S Bateman St and 23 Ave S. Officers identified the driver as NATNAEL I ZEGHERGHISH (DOB 05/02/1997). Other Officers met with the reporting party and investigated, Officers then confirmed that he was the suspect of the Assault, and he also matched the description given by dispatch. Officers then arrested NATNAEL for DV Assault 4. His MIRANDA rights were read which he verbally acknowledged yes to. NATNAEL was subsequentially transported the South Precinct.

Officers spoke with the reporting party and identified her as RUTH ARAYA (DOB 01/01/1977), she stated the following:

Her son NATNAEL lives with her, and he is diagnosed with schizophrenia, he has been off his medication for approximately 2 month and his mental health has been declining. NATNAEL has never been assaultive or aggressive in the past but tonight 06/04/24 he was assaultive. She was asleep inside her bedroom which is located on the first floor of the home. She woke up to NATNAEL in her room hoovering over her stating something along the lines that his family is making kids off of him. NATNAEL then began to slap her on the face approximately three separate times, she then began to yell out loud to get the attention from her family. As he was slapping her, he proceeded to say, “I will kill you”. RUTH stated that she was not in fear and did not believe that he would follow through with it. After he slapped her, he proceeded to grab her by the cheeks with one hand. She was then able to kick him away from her, grab her phone, and state she was going to call 911. When she kicked NATNAEL he exited the room and proceeded to tell his mom “Don’t call 911” multiple times. He did not try to take her phone away; he was just telling her verbally. She believed that when NATNAEL was telling her to not call 911, he was sorry for his actions, he had time to realize that what he had done was wrong. She proceeded to call 911. NATNAEL then proceeded to go upstairs to his room, grab his jacket and key, exit the home and drove away.

A witness who is also the grandfather of NATNAEL identified as GHEBRU A. ANDESHKNEN (09/15/1947) stated the following:

He had heard the disturbance, when he came out, he found RUTH laying on the floor with NATNAEL standing above her. He believed that NATNAEL was going to harm RUTH. He proceeded to push NATNAEL away from RUTH.

RUTH’S daughter identified as BEILUL I ZEGHERGHISH (DOB 06/24/1998) who also lives in the same household stated that she heard the disturbance but did not see what happened. She also informed Officers that NATNAEL has been previously transported to the hospital for the Involuntary Treatment Act by officers in the past due to NATNAEL walking in the streets naked. She stated that he was hospitalized for months, he was then released in which he got better. Months later he then declined and was hospitalized again for approximately a week in a half.

RUTH declined any medical attention and Officers did not observe any injuries.

Since NATNAEL stated that he preferred his family move his car for him, RUTH was transported to the vehicle which was illegally parked at the intersection of S Bateman St and 23 Ave S. She was left in custody of the vehicle.

Officers arrested NATNAEL for RCW 9A.36.041 DV Assault in the fourth degree.

The family stated that they would like NATNAEL to be referred to the mental health court, they believe this is the cause of his aggression.

SGT C. Gregorio #6827 screened the arrest at the south Precinct.

DV supplement was submitted.

DV pamphlet and incident number were given.

NATNAEL was booked into the King County Jail.
