# Seattle Police Department Public Git Repository

## Description

In relation to Seattle PD’s (SPD) Bias-Free Policing, the Consent Decree includes the mandate that SPD “deliver police services that are equitable, respectful, and free of unlawful bias, in a manner that promotes broad community engagement and confidence in the Department.” In response to the decree, this public Git repository will demonstrate transparency and scalable transferability. The repository allows for an engaged user outside of the organization to follow and have confidence that SPD follows a competent, professional, and trustworthy approach to publication. Other agencies (provided adequate infrastructure) will be able to download and implement these processes with minimal effort.

Public Data sets are leveraged in these projects and can be found at [SPD Open Data](https://data.seattle.gov/)
