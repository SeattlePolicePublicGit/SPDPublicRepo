# PSW (Propensity Score Weighting) - Gender Disparity

## Description

An inverse propensity score weighting technique was implemented to assess gender disparity among SPD employees. The goal of this technique is to balance gender groups on potential confounders, creating groups that are comparable on observed characteristics. The balanced groups are compared on number of promotions, complaints, highest rank held, and dollars earned (gross). 

The results of this analysis are dicussed by Dr. Lois James in the SPD Gender Disparity report, which includes a technical appendix. The definitions of the variables can be found in the provided codebook.
